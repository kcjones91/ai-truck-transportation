# Dump Truck Company Roadmap (2025–2026)

## Overview
This project outlines the steps to establish and scale a dump truck company by 2026.  
Key goals:
- Reduce debt for better financing or cash purchase of equipment.
- Build a compliant and scalable business model.
- Differentiate with **AI-driven logistics** and **transparent fuel surcharge policies**.

---

## Objectives
- **Financial Prep:** Minimize debt → qualify for favorable loan rates or pay outright.  
- **Compliance:** Secure all state/federal registrations.  
- **Lead Generation:** Build reliable work pipeline via LinkedIn, platforms, and direct outreach.  
- **Differentiation:** Use AI + telematics to guarantee timely delivery and reduced costs.

## 30/60/90 Day Plan

### Days 1–30: Foundation
- [ ] Form LLC, obtain EIN, open business bank account.  
- [ ] Research intrastate (TxDMV) vs interstate (USDOT/MC) authority.  
- [ ] File **IRS Form 2290 (HVUT)** for heavy vehicles.  
- [ ] Begin insurance quotes: auto liability, physical damage, cargo, GL, workers’ comp.  
- [ ] Build v1 lead list (100 targets: contractors, quarries, municipalities).  

### Days 31–60: Go-to-Market
- [ ] File FMCSA URS or TxDMV motor carrier authority.  
- [ ] Establish **fuel surcharge policy** using DOE/EIA diesel index.  
- [ ] Register on load boards (TRUX, DumpTruckLoads).  
- [ ] Launch LinkedIn outreach (10–15 messages/day).  

### Days 61–90: Optimize Operations
- [ ] Implement telematics/dashcams (Samsara, Geotab).  
- [ ] Prototype AI dispatching with **Google OR-Tools VRP**.  
- [ ] Create 1-page marketing sheet + simple website.

## Business Model Options
1. **Owner-Operator (local, intrastate)**  
   - Hourly, per-load, or ton-mile billing + FSC.  
   - Simpler compliance; local demand focus.  

2. **Subcontracting (brokers/material providers)**  
   - Use TRUX, DumpTruckLoads, quarries, demo firms.  
   - Faster ramp but platform fees.  

3. **Interstate For-Hire (regional)**  
   - Requires USDOT + MC authority.  
   - Access to industrial and disaster contracts.  

4. **Municipal/Public Works**  
   - Register as a vendor and bid annual hauling contracts.  

---

## Pricing & Fuel Surcharges
- **Base rate** (hourly/per-load) + **Fuel Surcharge** (tied to EIA weekly diesel).  
- Formula: `FSC = a + b × (EIA price – baseline)`  
- Add: standby time, disposal fees, overtime, minimum call-out.  

---

## Compliance Checklist
- [ ] USDOT & MC Operating Authority (if interstate/for-hire).  
- [ ] TxDMV Motor Carrier number (for Texas intrastate).  
- [ ] IRS **Form 2290 (HVUT)** annually.  
- [ ] Commercial auto liability + other insurance coverage.  
- [ ] Safety program (maintenance logs, telematics, driver compliance).  

---

## Lead Generation Strategy
**Target Roles:** Estimators, Project Managers, Dispatchers, Procurement Officers.  
**Industries:** Sitework, excavation, demolition, paving, utilities, aggregate suppliers, ready-mix, municipalities.  
**LinkedIn Keywords:** “sitework contractor,” “excavation contractor,” “aggregate supplier,” “asphalt paving,” “ready-mix dispatch,” “public works procurement.”  

**Sample Message:**  
> “Local, on-time hauling with GPS-verified ETAs and AI-optimized routing.  
> Indexed fuel pricing and transparent reporting reduce costs.  
> Can we be added to your truck list?”

---

## AI & Telematics Edge
- **AI Dispatch Optimization:** Google OR-Tools VRP for routing and scheduling.  
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Use telematics alerts to minimize downtime.  
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Share truck locations and timestamps with clients.  
- **Dynamic FSC Updates:** Automated weekly updates tied to EIA diesel index.
